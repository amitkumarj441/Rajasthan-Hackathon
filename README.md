Developing ManhoodCoin based on Blockchain concept.

Description : Developing ManhoodCoins point system where users can honour each other with ManhoodCoins. Later ManhoodCoins can also be collected by wearable devices, or smart meters, rewarding people saving resources (electricity, water, gas) or living a healthy lifestyle reported by their wearable device. To avoid abuse of the system these points are audited by a tweeting auditor (using twitter). The ManhoodCoins points can be used by companies and government bodies to reward people doing good to their communities, health and to the environment.
